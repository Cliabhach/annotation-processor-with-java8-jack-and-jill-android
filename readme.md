# Android Annotation Processor with Java 8 and Jack&Jill


## 2016/5/23 - After Google IO

- Testing code using Java8 with the latest Android Annotation Processor tool from
'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.2.0-alpha1'.
- Android N must be targeted and latest build tool ('24.0.0 rc4') must be used to work.
- It is working but generated code cannot be recognized by Android Studio.
- Extra library is needed to work -> 'com.google.guava:guava:18.0'.
